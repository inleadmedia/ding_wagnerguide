Module for integrating WagnerGuide with a ding1 site.

It inserts some javascript that looks for the "ting-availability" container,
then finds the Alma id / item number XXX from <div id="ting-item-XXX">.
It then waits for "ting-availability" to be populated with the holding lines,
and prepends the lines with a link to Wagnerguide.
